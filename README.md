# linux_live_gpu_temp_monitor
A small python script for monitoring your GPU  temperature
Tired of the lack of good tools to properly benchmark and monitor your hardware when gaming in linux I've started this small script that I aim to increase its capabilities and usefulness during my free time.

The aim of this github project is to create better open source tools and information to make it easier for other Linux gamers or opther kinds of overclock enthusiasts to monitor their hardware. While using GPU or CPU intensive applications on Linux Distributions for the purpose of testing their hardware capabilities.
