# linux_live_gpu_temp_monitor
A small python script for monitoring your GPU  temperature
Tired of the lack of good tools to properly benchmark and monitor your hardware when gaming in linux I've started this small script that I am to increase its capabilities during my free tim.

The aim of this github project is to create better open source tools and information to make it easier for other Linux gamers or overclock enthusiast to monitor their hardware while using GPU or CPU intensive applications for the purpose of testing their hardware capabilities.
